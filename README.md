# CS2340A_Team26
Repo for CS2340A Semester Project. We created a dungeon crawler application where your goal is to navigate your character through a maze filled with deadly creatures before you run out of health. We have powerups to make it a little bit easier for you to make it through the maze. Try to get as high of a score as possible and show off your leaderboard position to your friends!

## Getting Started

After cloning the repository, please download android studio and import the project into there. We recommend running this application on Pixel 4 XL API 34 for best results. From there, you should be ready to play! Have fun!
